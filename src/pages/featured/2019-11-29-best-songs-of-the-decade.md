  It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog

  > It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log

  But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do

  Will make me feel **alright**

  You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things

  And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything

  So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

  _You know I feel ok_
