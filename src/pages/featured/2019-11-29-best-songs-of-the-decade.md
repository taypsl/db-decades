# Main intro text

But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do

Will make me feel **alright**

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things

And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

_You know I feel ok_
